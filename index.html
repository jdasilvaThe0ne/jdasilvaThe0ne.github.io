      <h1> <a href="tutorials.html"> Robot Operating System ROS2</a></h1>
      <p>
        Let's Learn Robot Operating system(ROS2). This site documents my projects,
        tutorials, notes, and experiments with ROS2 (including the Kilted Kaju Jazzy build) lets get started.
      </p><p> Before we get started let first answer a few concepts; </p>
      <ol>
        
       <li><h5>Why does industries use ROS</h5> </li>
             <p>>Robots are becomings widely used in manufacturing industries. Having ROS as opensurce ( a community)
             allows everyone to use as it, whitout limitation.  Persons in the commuity can also Publish to the
             software. Over the year this has seen to be fruitful to both researchers and manufactuting 
             industries globaly. To get a better understanding of the type of benifits OpenSource ROS has 
             provided check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BllUJLtAcgc">this</a> video  on youtube. </p>
            

        <li><h5>Middleware (bridging hardware with applicattion)</h5> </li>
               <p>In Robtics Middleware acts like  a driver. It creates a bridge between the robots hardware coponets suchs as <b>sensors</b>
               and <b>actuators</b>  and the software. Providing a communication pipeline for data exchange  and scheduling,
               which are required  for building complex systems(robots). If a robot’s components don’t work in coordination, 
               it stops being intelligent and becomes nothing more than a piece of metal. For a conceptual overview  o ROS2 middleware interface please 
               visit <a href="https://design.ros2.org/articles/ros_middleware_interface.html">ROS2 Middleware interface</a></p>
        <li><h5>Is ROS2 important for real robots</h5> </li>
              <p>>As mentioned earlier Robots is being largely used in industrial settings, many time  diffrern robots 
              work of different aspects of the production. With  ROS2's realtime cabbilities, manufacturing plants 
              are provided with resured precise timing.  Additionally  since each component(Node) of robot works somewhat independenttly
              but at the same time syncronised, they can be turnred off  independently. </p>

        <li><h5>Where we use ROS</h5> </li>
             <p> is openedsource  and has been applied in differrent areas within society. Robots for space
             exploration(robonaut 2 ), customer service(pepper) and manufacruting JetArm Pro. These are some of the areas where the robots built 
             are designed using ROS2 </p>
