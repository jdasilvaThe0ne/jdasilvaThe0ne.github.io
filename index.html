      <h1>Robotics & Autonomous Systems</h1>

      <p>
        Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical design,
        electronics, control theory, and software engineering to create intelligent
        machines capable of sensing, decision-making, and action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Modern robotics systems increasingly rely on middleware frameworks such as
        <strong>ROS 2 (open source) </strong>  to manage communication, scalability, and real-time
        constraints across distributed components. They are becomings widely used in manufacturing 
        industries, with it's opeen source nature,everyone to use as it, whitout limitation. 
        Persons in the commuity can also Publish to the software. Over the years this has proved to be fruitful to both
        researchers and manufactuting industries globaly. To get a better understanding of the type of benifits OpenSource ROS has 
        provided check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BllUJLtAcgc">this</a> video  on youtube.
      </p>

      <p>
        This portfolio documents hands-on laboratory work focused on ROS 2,
        robot modeling, simulation, control, and system integration.

      <h2>Key Application Areas</h2>

      <p>
        Robotics technologies are deployed across a wide range of industries,
        addressing challenges that require precision, autonomy, and adaptability.
        For Example Robots for space exploration(robonaut 2 ), customer service(pepper) 
        and manufacruting JetArm Pro. Are some of the areas an the robots that are built 
         are designed for specific use case using ROS2

    <section>
      <h2>Why ROS 2?</h2>

      <p>
        ROS 2 is a middleware designed to support real-world
        robotic systems. It emphasizes reliability,
        security, and real-time performance, which is crucial in enablling the robot 
        to interact with its environment smoothly
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally,standardized interfaces, ROS 2 enables developers to
        transition seamlessly from simulation to deployment on physical robots.
