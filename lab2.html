      <h2>Configuring ROS</h2>

      <p>
        Before using ROS 2 commands, the environment must be sourced. This sets
        required environment variables so that ROS packages and tools can be
        discovered by the system.
      </p>

      <pre>
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
      </pre>

      <p>
        Or it can  added  to the .bashrc file  and when you are ready to use 
        simply enter the command source .bashrc  instead. <b>Note</b> you must  be in your home directory
        before running these commands
<pre>
echo "source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash" >> .bashrc 
source .bashrc 
</pre>
        To confirm the installation, the ROS 2 version ( on windows using wsl)  use the command: if it fails
        you may need to install  "pip"   here we see we are using <b> ROS version 0.32.6</b>
      </p>

      <pre>
pip show ros2cli

      <p>
        Ros2 commes with the default robot simulator <strong>turtlesim</strong>  which ovides a simple 2D simulator that
        helpu you to understand core concepts of ROS2 such as nodes, topics, services, and
        parameters.  To have a feel of what im referring, use the same terminal as before and execute
        the below commands.
      </p>

      <pre>
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
      </pre>

      <p>
        The teleoperation(telop) node publishes movements commands that control the turtle’s
        movement using the keyboard a total of 8 keys is available for moving the robot(turtle).

      <h2>Understanding Nodes</h2>

      <p>
        A node is an executable that uses the ROS 2 API to perform a specific tas
        within a robotics system. Much like a graph have vertices Robots(or Robot Operating System) work with  multiple components 
            that are called Node. They allow the robot to achieve syncronization with the different  robtos parts.  Nodes  connect to 
            each other to intechange or communicate data  via topics, services  or actions. According to <a  href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09933"> 
                Impact of ROS2 Node Composition  in Robotic System</a> where more detailed can be found. There are three types of Nodes:
            <li> Node ( without Qualifier) much like a constructer in a object oriented programming 
                language
            <li>Lifecycle Nodes</li> 
            <li>Composition Nodes
      </p>

      
        
       <div class="vote-box">
        <p><strong>Statement:</strong> A node is an executable that uses ROS 2 APIs.</p>

        <button onclick="vote('agree')">Agree</button>
        <button onclick="vote('disagree')">Disagree</button>

        <p>
            👍 Agree: <span id="agreeCount">0</span> |
            👎 Disagree: <span id="disagreeCount">0</span>

        To see which nodes are  active  and determine the status of its attributes  use 
        use the below command.  In this case only the turtlesim_node is running so only this node is displayed. 
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding Topics</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Analogy:</strong> T
        In the section above we spoke about Nodes,and stated that the communicate with each other to achieve syncronization,  
        across the differnt hardware and software components  across the robot. For communication ( the edge of the graph)
        ROS 2 uses what are called topics. Topics are like a constant line of output where  an output 
        can be published/written  and read by multiples nodes.  this constant update, read/write  allows all each Nodeto know the
         status of it neighbours in real time. It functions  simalar to a broadcast message or group chat. 
          
         <br><br>In RoS2 there are always two topics running(listening) 
        <li> /paramter_events</li>
        <li> rosout</li>
        </p>
        <p>
         run  the below command  you'll see  three additional topics added. 
      </p>
      
      
      <!--p>
        Topics that are currently active can be listed and inspected:

        let's  view the position of the turtle using the commands below.   The second comand 
         cause the turtle  to move in a circle.

         <p class="error">
         Note in my installation(WSL) the topic "pose" keeps cycling see video below.  
         The ubuntu installation however does not behaive this way,  it just    prints 
         it once ans waits for  other instructios. In my opinion this data should 
         only be updated when the simulator is given and instruction. for example
           when on of the arrow key is pressed which cause the turtle on the simulator  to react
       </p>

      <p>
        Publishing to a topic sends commands directly to the turtle: for example the 
        command <code> ros2 topic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/twist "{linear: {x: 2.0}, angular: {z: 1.5}}"
      </code> tells ros to move the turtlesim in cirtular manner  see video below. here you can 
      see the action being repeated indefinitly  as it goes round and round.

      <h2>Understanding Services</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Analogy:</strong> Services are like making a phone call. A request is
        sent, and the caller waits for a response before continuing, unlike the topics 
        service are one to one.  a unique channel i created for communication and ends 
        by either  ther server or client.

      <p>The first commands shows hte list of services  available for call.  <b>Note:</b> if no node is

        understanding. If after calling clear  you attempt to move the turtle again you will see
        it move an leave a trace. this is expected as the service call has completed(ended)

      <h2>Understanding Parameters</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Analogy:</strong> Parameters are like robot preferences or settings
        that can be adjusted without changing the program code. thing that can passsed
        directly to the th robot for example in a real robot  a paramerter could be  "turn on  head light 
        brightness 75%", or night vision enable  if time >16:00. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Parameters are useful in testing, development, and production environments
        where behavior must be tuned dynamically fo the robtot to interact with it's environment 
        intelligently. By setting  the red and blue color to 55 and the the green to 255 you ge the color shown in the image

    <section id="actions">
      <h2>Understanding Actions</h2>

      <p>
        Actions are similar to services but are designed for long-running tasks.
        They provide feedback and allow goals to be canceled. This behaivour is becessary 
        as the robot environment may change  dynamically.  for examale if instruction is given
        to the robot  move forward 12 feet but at feet 11  it hits  a wall. the feedback
        provided by the by the action will allow the  instuction to be terminately 
        prematurely. Or for a new instrtion to be given. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Actions vs Services:</strong> Actions are used when execution time
        is significant or progress feedback is required as described above. This is necessay given
        that. not because you can do something means you should do it.  For example. if a robot is at the end of a cliff;
        technically i can go forward. but the feed back may allow the central monitor to send a halt 
        or danger-stop instruction. Below  we see that  the action available for the turtle is 
        <b>turtle1/rotate_absolute</b>  in the video  theta means move the turtle 90 degree. counter 
        clockwise.  <b>Note</b> if the turle is already  at  90 degree with respect to zero 
        so don't think your turtle is broken when yoy don't see it move the second time i.e the new value must be differrent
        if you  expect the turtle to move.
