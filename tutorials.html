      <h1>Tutorial 1 – Getting Started With ROS2</h1>
      <p>
        This tutorial guides you through ROS2 installation, verifying your setup,
        and understanding core ROS2 concepts. ROS2 can can be deployed using various methods
        however today we will only be looking at  Installing it on ubuntu noble(lts 24.04) via the debian package

      <h2>1. What is ROS2?</h2>
      <p>
        ROS2 (Robot Operating System version 2) is a flexible framework for writing
        robot software. It provides tools, libraries, and conventions to simplify 
        the task of creating complex robotics behavior.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Installing ROS2 (Jazzy/Noble)</h2>
      <p>
        If you prefer to build from source you can follow the instructons here: 
      </p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ros2/ros2/blob/kilted/ros2.repos">Source github.com</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don't worry if you are unfamiliar with robotics or Linux...</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>
          First let's make sure the system supports the correct character encoding:
    
          <pre>
$ locale
# Look for UTF-8. If not present:
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
$ sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
$ sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
# Then verify again
          </pre>
        </li>
      
      </ul>
      <p>The libries required for the installation are from the  <b>Ubuntu Universe repository</b> so we must add this before starting the installation
      <pre>
      
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository universe


      </pre>
    ROS2 is constantly changing  by the vast community so to get
    the newest features and fixed we must install the latest update:
    uses these commands to get the most updated files. 
    <br>
    To ge teh installion  we need to   <b>curl</b> so if  you dont have it installed 
     instll using this command
     <pre>
      
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install curl -y 
      
     </pre>
Now lets serach for the latest installation file download it an installation
<pre>

$ export ROS_APT_SOURCE_VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/ros-infrastructure/ros-apt-source/releases/latest | grep -F "tag_name" | awk -F\" '{print $4}')

$ curl -L -o /tmp/ros2-apt-source.deb "https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros-apt-source/releases/download/${ROS_APT_SOURCE_VERSION}/ros2-apt-source_${ROS_APT_SOURCE_VERSION}.$(. /etc/os-release && echo ${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-${VERSION_CODENAME}})_all.deb"

$ sudo dpkg -i /tmp/ros2-apt-source.deb

</pre>
 To ensure that  everything went well lets test the version that was installed  we should see something like This
 Unfortunately my ubuntu mancihine is currenlty out of reach so i installed ROS on window understanding
 Windows subsystem for Linux.  the installation process is basically the same
  only this time on window.<br>
  before we start exacuting commands  lets check to ensure we have hte correct(latest version installed)
  as of December 12 2025 the latest version is avaiable for  Ubuntu 20.04 ( Noble) as mentioned earlier run the below command
  if you have  ubuntu it would be <b>ros2 --version</b> instead
<pre>
  printenv ROS_DISTRO

</pre> 
you should see a result like this (jazzy) corresponding to ubuntu 24.04
<div class="tutorial-image">
 <img src="assets/img/ros2_version.png" alt="Ros version">
</div>
 
    </p>
<p>
We will now test that our installation is working correctly by  running a simulation
ope two terminals  and place them to the right of the screen, one above the other as 
seen in the image below. In the top terminal run 
<code>
    ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node

</code>
An image similar to the one shown on the left should appear with an animated turtle in the center 
we can move the image much  you would move a robot but first we must tell ros2 that we want to 
to start moving it. In the  second terminal enter <code> ros2 run turtlesim_teleop_key</code> this will give you a list of keys
you can press to move the turtle.
as you press the keys the top right terminal will tell you if the action has copleted or 
another instruction has causes it to top. this is denote orange text in the top righ terminal [Warn]

      <h2>3. Undestanding Nodes</h2>
          <p>Much like a graph have Nodes Robots(or Robot Operating System) work with  multiple components 
            that are called Node. They allow the robot to acieve syncronization amongnst  different parts, 
            they are units of processing.  Nodes  connect to heach other to intechange or communicatde data  via topics, services
            or actions. According to <a  href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09933"> Impact of ROS2 Node Composition  in Robotic System</a> where more detailed cann b found 
            there are three types of Nodes: 
            <ul><li>
            Node (without Qualifier) Much like  object contructer in java. or any object oriented programming language. 

            </li>
           <li>
            Lificycle Node
            </li>
            <li>
            Composition Nodes

            </li>
           </ul>
           with each severing a different purpose. to determine currently available Nodes  within the turtlesim
           simply enter the comand <code> ros2 node list </code> in our example we exptect to see tow nodes( two components running)
           <b>teleop_turtle</b> and <b> turtlesim</b> this is becasuse earlier we  initialised these two
           node  the commands <code> ros2 run turtlesim_node</code> and <code>ros2 run turtelsim turtlesim_teleop_key</code>
           if we were to  cancel these two run we would get an empty output after sinning <code> ros2 node list</code>
           <div class="tutorial-image">
                <img src="assets/img/node_list.png" alt="Node List Ros2">
                </div>
            
            </ul>
          To get information relating to a particular node we use the command  (in the turtlesim simulator)  <code>ros2  node info /turtlesim</code>
          the  image below the the details associated  the /turtelsim node

          </p>
  <!--Section 4-->
  <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Undestanding Topics</h2>
          <p>In the section above we spoke about Nodes much like a graph would have and we also stated that the communicate with each other to achieve full syncronization 
            across the robot. for communication ( the edge of the graph) ROS 2 uses what are called topics. Topics are like a constant line of output where  an output  can be published/written 
            and read by multiples nodes.  this constant update, read/write  allows all each Nodeto know the status of it neighbours in real time.  
          
           there are always two topics running(listening) 
           <code>
            <ul>
              <li>parameter_events</li>
              <li>rosout</li>
            </ul>



           </code>
          
           
           
           <div class="tutorial-image">
                <img src="assets/img/default_topics.png" alt="Default Topics">
                </div>
          After we start the turtelsim and turtle_teleop_key  these three additional topics start
          <code><ul>
            <li>turtle1/cmd_vel </li>
            <li>turtle1/color_sensor</li>
            <li>turtle1/pose</li>
          </ul> </code>
           if we take a look at the type of data that the topic <code>turtle1/pose</code>uses we see  four(4) Real valuse that represents
           the  postions on the X and y axis, along with the linear and algular velocity for a total 
           of four value. <b>NOTE!!</b> in the installation of ros2 under  Windows subsytem for liux(our current installation)
           there appears to be a bug as het current "pose" data keeps repeating indefintitly  with the starting state 
           In my opinion this data should only be updated when the simulator is given and instruction. for example
           when on of the arrow key is pressed as the cause the turtle on the simulator  to react

           represent bot

          lets  do a bit of an experiment, lets tell  the turtle to move forward at a speed of 2.0 and 
          at the same time rutning a a rate of 1.5.  the iage below shows the resulting  path the turtle would 
          take if we were to sent the following commnad <code>ros2 topic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 2.0}, angular: {z: 1.5}}</code>
